[2023-07-12 10:38:13 PM] Haskell is awesome. It have three languages built in.
1. Term level => the one that we use, which contain real bits during runtime.
2. Type level => Like C, C++, it constraints terms used like Integers, FLoat, Rational, etc. during compile-time.
3. Kind level => It constrains Types, saying what kind of type is allowed, etc. during compile time.

haskell provides ways to cross boundaries between these languages.
1. Functions: Term -> Term
2. TypeCalsses: Type -> Term
3. Type Families: Type -> Type
4. GADT: Term -> Type ; wierd how runtime infomration can effect compile-time??

It doesn;t It allows runtime information to constrains the type, and then we can uses type-classes to constrain term level information.
