[2023-07-08 10:35:48 AM] Hi I am awesome

[2023-07-08 10:36:03 AM] I have setup jrnl

[2023-07-09 11:06:15 AM] I have been wasting away my time configuring system, it was almost one day.
I should be happy with what I have and try to make it work.

[2023-07-10 09:13:09 AM] today I exercised my share options to chekc wheter money goes to my bank account or share account?

[2023-07-12 10:38:13 PM] Haskell is awesome. It have three languages built in.
1. Term level => the one that we use, which contain real bits during runtime.
2. Type level => Like C, C++, it constraints terms used like Integers, FLoat, Rational, etc. during compile-time.
3. Kind level => It constrains Types, saying what kind of type is allowed, etc. during compile time.

haskell provides ways to cross boundaries between these languages.
1. Functions: Term -> Term
2. TypeCalsses: Type -> Term
3. Type Families: Type -> Type
4. GADT: Term -> Type ; wierd how runtime infomration can effect compile-time??

It doesn;t It allows runtime information to constrains the type, and then we can uses type-classes to constrain term level information.

[2023-07-12 10:45:58 PM] Haskell always check the instance head and if it matches, then it checks the constraints attached to that head.
instance <constraints> => C <types>
                          HEAD

[2023-07-14 10:38:51 AM] pattern matching a term in haskell reveals type level information and that's how whole GADT works.

[2023-07-16 03:35:51 PM] way to learn haskell:
1. cis194 spring 2013
2. https://github.com/system-f/fp-course
3. CS240H standford course

[2023-07-21 03:59:57 PM] reading resource directory in jar environment is difficult, so I have used macros for compiling all resource data during compile time and use it in runtime. Which was fun and challenging.

[2023-07-21 06:50:19 PM] today I gave a session on benchamrking and load generation tools and response was okay;
some action items:
1. make it more general and available for public use.
2. talk with other teams in gopay and find, what kind of tools are to be used.
